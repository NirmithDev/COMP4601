## Lab 4

## Main Requirements

1. Your server for this lab should use the fruit website data generated by your crawler from the previous lab. Your server is required to index the data and provide the required search functionality. You must include at least the page title and the page body contents within the index. You can include additional data if you desire.

2. The home page for your server (i.e., URL /), must serve a page in which the user can enter a simple text search query and submit the search request. In response to a search request, your server must perform a search using the indexed data and return an HTML page containing a list of the top 10 search results. Each search result must include at least the URL to the original page, the title of the original page, and the search score generated by your search engine for this search query.

3. As part of your demonstration, you should include some brief analysis of why you think the returned search results are ranked in a relevant manner (e.g., by looking at several pagesâ€™ data and comparing that data to the search terms).
