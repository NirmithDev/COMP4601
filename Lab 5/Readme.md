## Lab 5

## Main Requirements

- Target 1: Data Crawling
  Crawl the network structure data from the provided root URL: https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~davidmckenney/fruitgraph.
  Store the crawled data in a structured format, such as a list of pages with their outgoing links.

- Target 2: PageRank Calculation
  Implement the PageRank algorithm using power iteration with the provided parameters: alpha value of 0.1 and stopping iteration when the Euclidean distance is less than 0.0001.

  Calculate PageRank values for each page in the crawled data using the PageRank algorithm.

- Target 3: Display PageRank Results 5. Print out the PageRank values for all the pages after the calculation is complete.
  Sort the pages based on their PageRank values in descending order.
  Display the PageRank values for the top 25 highest ranked pages.

- Target 4: Explanation and Documentation 8. Provide a detailed explanation of the approach and code used for PageRank calculation.

  Document any libraries or algorithms used, including any modifications to the algorithm to match the specified parameters.
  Include comments in your code to explain the key steps of the PageRank calculation.

### FYI

- The Temp folder was for instructions and understanding!
